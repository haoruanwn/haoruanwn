### Hi there, I'm haoruanwn ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Electronic and Information Engineering**. 

My passion lies at the intersection of hardware and software. I am deeply fascinated by embedded systems, from low-level microcontroller programming to running complex applications on Linux-based systems on a chip (SoCs). I enjoy building, tinkering, and bringing ideas to life through code and circuits.
